# So you want to contribute to pod-embedded-beta...
Awesome! We're glad to have you!

This set of guidelines will detail what you should know before contributing, as well as how to actually commit changes to the repository.

## What do I need to know before I contribute?
### Know where to get help!
Always feel free to reach out on Teams, the #controls channel is a great place to start.
### Get familiar with the repository!
Take a look at the [README](README.md) if you haven't already. It details the structure of the repository as well as how to set up your build environment.
### Take a look at the style guide!
We use [Google's C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) for this repository, and our pre-commit formatter enforces this guide.
### Some more things you should know
For this repository, we want to try to write object oriented code as much as possible to provide an easier transition from the CS curriculum at UW-Madison.

We also like to make sure our code is well documented, not only in the sources themselves, but in the repository as well. Take a look at our [devices](embedded/devices) folder for an example of our in-repo README documentation.
## How do I contribute?
### You found a bug
Open an issue in Jira! Describe it well, and, if you think you can fix it, keep on reading!
### You want to write some code, but don't know where to start
Take a look at Jira and feel free to work on any unassigned issues. Let someone know so we can get it assigned to you!

Feel free to reach out on Teams if you are looking for something to do as well.
### You've wrote some code
Push your remote branch and open a pull request! Ensure you follow branch and commit naming conventions listed [here](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/reference-issues-in-your-development-work/). Again, make sure you describe it well! When you feel like things are in a good state assign it to someone for review. If you aren't sure who to assign it to, again, please reach out on Teams!
